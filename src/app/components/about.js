                Hi! My name is Alex. I am a PhD candidate 
                in Computer Science at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign (UIUC), where I am advised by Dr. Karrie Karahalios as a part of the Social Spaces Group. 
                Prior to being at UIUC, I earned a BS in Computer Science 
                and Computer Engineering from the University of Southern California (USC). While there, I was 
                mentored by Dr. Heather Culbertson as an undergraduate researcher in the Haptics Robotics and Virtual Interaction lab, where I worked on tactile, block-based programming.

                Broadly, my research interests are in the area of Human-Computer Interaction, with focuses on 
                Accessibility, Human-AI Interaction, and Education. In my dissertation work, I study the implications 
                of technology, and in particular AI, for the participation of disabled persons in higher education. I explore how 
                existing AI tools are used by students to address unmet access needs, and I design human-centric systems for supporting the development self-advocacy skills.

                Beyond my dissertation work, I am also interested in problems related to online information seeking polarization&mdash;this other strand of my research 
                examines the socio-demographic factors associated with different online searching behaviors. I have also done work around understanding the relationship between growth, moderation, and the development of online communities. 
                Outside of research, you can catch me playing soccer, scrolling through funny cat 
                posts on Reddit, or perfecting my healthy brownie recipe (yes, it&apos;s a thing!).
