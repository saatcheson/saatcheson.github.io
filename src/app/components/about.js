                Hi! My name is Alex (my first name is actually Samuel&mdash;it&apos;s a funny story). I am a PhD candidate 
                in Computer Science at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, where I am a member of the Social Spaces 
                research group advised by Dr. Karrie Karahalios. Prior to my time at Illinois, I earned a BS in Computer Science 
                and Computer Engineering from the University of Southern California. While there, I was fortunate to have been 
                mentored by Dr. Heather Culbertson in the Haptics Robotics and Virtual Interaction lab.

                Broadly, I am interested in problems in the area of Human-Computer Interaction, particularly as they relate to 
                Accessibility, Human-AI Interaction, and Education. In my own work, I study the implications 
                of AI technology for the participation of disabled persons in higher education. I both explore how 
                existing AI tools are used by students to address access needs and design systems for improving the 
                processes involved in creating access.

                I am also interested in problems related to information seeking, where another strand of my research 
                examines the factors affecting how different people seek information online. In the past, I have also investigated growth 
                in online communities. Outside of research, you can catch me playing soccer, scrolling through funny cat 
                posts on Reddit, or perfecting my apple sauce recipe.
