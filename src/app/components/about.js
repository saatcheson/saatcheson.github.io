                Hi! My name is Alex. I am a PhD candidate 
                in Computer Science at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign (UIUC), where I am advised by Dr. Karrie Karahalios in the Social Spaces Group. 
                Prior to being at UIUC, I earned a BS in Computer Science 
                and Computer Engineering from the University of Southern California (USC). While at USC, I was 
                mentored by Dr. Heather Culbertson as an undergraduate researcher in the Haptics Robotics and Virtual Interaction lab, where I worked on tactile, block-based programming.

                Broadly, my research interests are in the area of Human-Computer Interaction, with focuses on 
                Accessibility, Human-AI Interaction, and Education. In my dissertation work, I study the implications 
                of technology, and in particular AI, for the participation of disabled persons in higher education. I both explore how 
                existing AI tools are used by students to address unmet access needs and design human-centric systems for developing self-advocacy skills.

                Beyond my dissertation work, I am also interested in problems related to information seeking, where another strand of my research 
                examines the factors associated with different online searching behaviors. In the past, I have also investigated associations between growth and moderator activity on the development of online communities. 
                Outside of research, you can catch me playing soccer, scrolling through funny cat 
                posts on Reddit, or perfecting my healthy brownie recipe (yes, it&apos;s a thing!).
